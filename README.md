# Technologies Used:
## Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML, CSS

#Installation Instructions:
## Confused as to what this means

# User Stories:
## pretentious tech user:
### I want a visually minimalistic site where all the eye catching and and interesting elements are within the functionality. Like cool scrollables or animations.

## My girlfriend tech user:
### I just really want to see him express himself through the choicees he makes. I want who he is to become blended with who the website is. I want to read about him and not be overwhelmed by other design elements.

## Hiring manager:
###I want to be able to see his use of proper syntax and the elements and techniques he uses to get certaing things done. Does he use the clearer or easier way? or does he conflate it and make his job harder.

# Unsolved issues:
## I had a hard time figuring out how to turn the bootstrap accordian format from text to an image. I originally wanted it to be an image across the screen you would click and then it would show the rest of the info. Couldn't figure that out.

## I also wanted to make my about me page moveable. Each box I wanted to slide and as it moved, showed a picture representing that part of me.

# Next step is to try to find a solution to everything listed above. While also, of course, updating the aesthetic of the site as well as the tech used. I view this as a rough draft and I'm excited to improve upon it as we go along.
